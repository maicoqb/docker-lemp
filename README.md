### Docker LEMP

This is my Docker Lemp configuration.

Feel free to use this on your projects.

### How To

Clone this repository and execute the `init.sh`.

That will run the `docker-compose` command to start containers.

### Configure

Since [version 2 of `compose-file`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/#the-env-file), `docker-compose.yml` can have environment variables that are defined in the `.env` file.

Altrought if you need to change this values, change the `.env` then execute `init.sh` again.
